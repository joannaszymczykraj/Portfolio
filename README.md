## About me 

My name is Joanna Szymczyk-Raj. Until 2016, project research and project manager in a pharmamarketing company. Then mother-house manager. And so, after several years spent raising and caring for children, the moment has come to return to the labor market. After such a long time in any profession, I will start from the beginning - I have no illusions.
That is why, after deliberating, I decided to change my professional way and switch to a manual testing.
I believe that the IT industry is the industry of the future. If I am to start from scratch, I would like to work in a profession that will allow me to develop, fulfill, and give satisfaction on many levels.
In my professional work so far, I have both implemented projects for large clients from the pharmamarketing industry and managed a project team. It is difficult to find a balance between the professional and private spheres in such a position. That is why now I would like to realize myself as part of a greater whole. As an important part of the team. Taking care of quality, verification, precision, improvement has always been what "turned me on" at work. I feel that as a manual tester I will find what I am looking for - passion, balance and an endless path of development.

I admit that I am at the beginning of this path. But everything ahead of me. 
Participation in the Dare IT Challenge project was an important step forward.

### My experience 

My professional experience in testing so far is based on my own work and participation in the Dare IT Challenge project, where I had the opportunity to test web and mobile applications, perform exploratory tests, based on user stories, requirements and functional tests. I learned how to prepare test cases and execute them. I now know what to look for when reporting bugs or preparing a test report.
I got to know the bug reporting and project management tool which is Jira. I got to know Devtools and the basics of mySQL. 
I am still expanding my knowledge in the field of ISTQB - I am preparing for the basic level exam.

I intend to develop my skills and broaden the competences necessary to work as a manual tester.
I am convinced that my previous experience and acquired competences will prove useful in software testing. Precision, inquisitiveness, teamwork, ease of communication in the team (including the development team), great work organization will be my strengths as a manual testing adept.
